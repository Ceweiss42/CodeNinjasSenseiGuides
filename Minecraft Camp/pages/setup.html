            <h3>We want to make sure the camp runs as smoothly as possible, and throughout the
                 years we have found out some ways to make that happen! This should help eliminate all 
                 hiccups you might run into when doing the camp setup <br><br>
            </h3>

            <h3>First, let's create some workspaces. I like to follow a naming 
                scheme for these workspaces, so mine are usually in the form of 
            </h3>
            <h3 class="link">
                {season}{year}{computerLetter}
            </h3>
            <h3>
                So, for example: sum23A, win24C, etc.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                The numbers will be parsed out when exporting, so it is best to do the letters,
                as "sum231" will parse into sum, as well as "sum232", "sum233", etc. Please make the workspaces on all the desktops, and maybe even some of the
                 laptops if the camp is REALLY full.<br><br>
                 To make the workspace, follow these instructions:

            <p class="inst" >Here, fill out the Mod display name. This is where you type your "sum23A" stuff. It should autocomplete the Mod ID and other stuff for you</p>

            
            <h3>That should be it, as long as you click "Create new Workspace"! Once again, make sure to do this to all computers</h3>
